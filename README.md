# File Metadata Microservice

## About
This is my project of the [File Metadata Microservice challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice) for the freeCodeCamp API and Microservice certification. It was built based on the boilerplate available [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/).

1. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.
3. When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

Example output:
{ name: 'image.jpg', type: 'image/jpeg', size: 103943 }

## Feedback
